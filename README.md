A collection of my **Data Structures and Algorithms** solutions, covering:  
- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  

Each problem is solved with clean, well-commented code, often using multiple approaches where possible.  
This repo serves as my **personal learning log** and a resource for anyone revising DSA concepts.
